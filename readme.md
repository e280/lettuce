### splitty-panelly tabby draggy-droppy leafy layout ui

- ğŸ‘‰ **https://lettuce.e280.org/** ğŸ‘ˆ *try it, nerd!*
- ğŸ“¦ `npm install @e280/lettuce`
- it's web components bruh
- pane splitting, resizing, vertical, horizontal, you get it
- it's like for editor apps and stuff like https://omniclip.app/
- you can drag-and-drop tabs between panels
	- done efficiently with *slots,* tab doesn't reinitialize or rerender to move
	- that's actually legit neato if you have heavy-weight stuff in tabs
